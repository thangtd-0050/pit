# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix 2026 Tax Regime Rates

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-05
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Summary**: All checklist items pass. The specification is clear, concise, and ready for planning.

**Key Strengths**:
- Critical bug clearly identified with exact before/after values
- Acceptance scenarios provide specific test cases with expected outputs
- Success criteria focus on accuracy and completeness
- Edge cases address test updates and user experience concerns
- Minimal scope reduces implementation risk

**No Issues Found**: The specification successfully describes WHAT needs to be fixed (incorrect tax rates) and WHY it matters (accuracy is core value) without specifying HOW to implement the fix.
